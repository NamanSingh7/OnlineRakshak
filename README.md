It is a platform designed for people who are suffering from some minor diseas and want to have some idea of what to do next. The Health Bot by Microsoft Azure will help you understand the level of problems you have and it will give you an idea of what you should do next.

It's totally free and anyone can use it.

A lot of people actually panic when the see some minor symptoms of any kind of illness. And a lot of people of ignore any kind of symptoms. Both of these situations can be dangerous. That's why I have created a platform where people can tell their problems to this bot and our bot can help them by guiding properly.

The webpage itself looks like this:

This is a one page static web app. You can click on "Get Started" button to chat with bot or just click on "Chat with Bot" button. After clicking any of the button, the webpage will take you to our health bot. It looks like this:

After that, you tell your problem to your bot. The bot will respond accordingly:
